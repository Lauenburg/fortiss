Highcharts is like D3_2.0 a data visualization for the data acquired by the deployed energy monitoring systems, but instead of D3, it uses the JavaScript Framework HighCharts.

Like D3_2.0 it provides a live view, an hour view, a day view and a month view. However, it misses the disaggregation capabilities.
