D3_2.0 is a versatile data visualization for the data acquired by the deployed energy monitoring systems using the JavaScript framework D3. 

The data is presented in the wollowing formats: 
 + Live view
 + Hour
 + Day
 + Month

For the **live view** it is possible to switch between the different B-3U4I-400 bricks as well as select and deselect the depicted variables power, phase shift, voltage, current and total harmonic distortion.

The **hour view** depicts a bar chart of the chosen hour, allowing to show an aggregated and disaggregated view of the three phases.

The **day view** as well as the **month view** can depict the data of the chosen time frame as a pie chart, bar chart or line chart. The bar chart and pie chart allows to aggregate and disaggregates between the three phases. Additionally, the pie chart can disaggregate the aggregated consumption for the single consumers and not assignable power consumption.
The line charts depict the consumption of a single consumer chosen in a drop-down menu.
